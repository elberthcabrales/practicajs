/**
 * Nick is standing next to a staircase that leads to his apartment.
 * The staircase has n total steps; Nick knows he can climb anywhere between 1 and m steps in one jump.
 * He thinks about how many ways there are to climb this staircase.
 * He realizes it is a big number since there are a lot of possible combinations.
 * So, he has asked you to write an algorithm for him
 * that tells him the number of possible ways to climb a staircase given n (number of steps) and, m (number of steps covered in biggest jump).
 *
 * input n = 4 and m = 2
 * expected staircase(n, m) = 5
